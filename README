NAME
    LSI::MegaSAS - Monitor LSI MegaRAID controllers

SYNOPSIS
    Use this module to determine the status of your LSI MegaRAID arrays on
    Linux.

        use LSI::MegaSAS;

        my $m = LSI::MegaSAS->new();

        # Convenience functions for monitoring:

        # Get a human-readable summary of all logical drives.
        my @drives =   $m->logical_drive_list;
    
        # Find array anomalies.
        my @failures = $m->logical_drive_failures;
        if(@failures) {
        ...

DESCRIPTION
    LSI has published a Linux tool called "MegaCli". This tool reports the
    status of MegaRAID disk arrays.

    This module is a Perl wrapper around that tool. Specifically, this
    module gives information on the physical enclosures, the physical
    drives, and the logical drives.

    At USGS we use this tool to track RAID failures in conjunction with
    our Big Brother monitoring system. You could also use this module to
    write a plugin for Nagios or any other monitoring system.
